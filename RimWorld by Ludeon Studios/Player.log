Trait Icons: Missing icons for traits, this is harmless, but if a mod that has support acording to the workshop has icons missing, tell me: 
Source: (sarg.alphagenes). Trait (Angelic beauty/AG_Beauty/angelic beauty). Trait Description: [PAWN_nameDef] possesses an unnatural, almost pristine beauty that makes [PAWN_objective] stand out among others of [PAWN_possessive] kind.
Source: (sarg.alphagenes). Trait (Repulsive/AG_Beauty/repulsive). Trait Description: [PAWN_nameDef] is so unfathomably ugly and grotesque that merely looking at [PAWN_objective] is enough to make other people nauseous.
Source: (mlie.falloutracestherobotspack). Trait (Simple minded/SimpleMindedRobot/Simple minded). Trait Description: Robots do not understand emotions on a logical level.
